This is the directory for the competition, it includes:
    make        - to build
    main.cpp    - the main file used to build executable
    prelim.h    - contains prelim and data class declarations
    prelim.cpp  - contains a class with
                    - constructor that takes an input file arg,
                    - print/ostream functions (for prelim and data)
                    - output_prelim_data function (outputs to file)
                    - funct (empty functor)
    input.txt   - an example of a potential input file

To build an executable from this directory, simply input:
	make

this will generate a build subdirectory and an executable "./server"
which takes no command line arguments.

Please perform make clean before pushing to github(or make sure not to add build/executables).
